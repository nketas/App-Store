# WordPress App Store theme

## Overview

My employer has an Enterprice license and needed an easy way to host our internal Apps. I googled around and found some expensive solutions, so I decided to write a Wordpress Theme that converts your instance to an App Store.

### How do I use it?

#### Installation

1. Start by checking out the repo to your wp-content/themes/
2. Activate the theme from your admin interface
3. You're done!

### Uploading a new App

1. Sign in to your Wordpress
2. Go to Media and upload your App icon and and your IPA
3. Open your .PLIST and insert your icon and IPA url
3. Create a new 'App' from the left side menu
4. Write the title of your App
5. Upload the IPA to the App on the right hand side
6. Set the icon you uploaded earlier as featured image
7. Publish!

### What about the license?

Feel free to use however you want to! This is open source and will always stay that way. I would appreciate if you sent me a message if you are going to use this, I'm very interested in hearing your thoughts and feedback :)
